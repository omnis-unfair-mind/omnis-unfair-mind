hello, i'm omni. i'm a beginner within the field of computer science and i am currently learning python. i am not ready to contribute to open source projects yet as i am still learning the more complex basics to python. here are some things about me:

>i am a 14 year old girl who started programming with a bbc microbit in year 7, at the age of 11.

>i've used javascript, html, c+ and micropython in the past. i plan to extend my knowledge on javascript and c+ once i have finished with python.

>i am a computer science student.

thank you for reading my profile! i will expand on this once i familiarise myself with github a little further.
